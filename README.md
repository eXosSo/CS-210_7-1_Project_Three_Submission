# "Summarize the project and what problem it was solving."
#
# The program developed will read and manipulate data from the included input file based on input from the user when prompted (i.e. if the user prompts for the number of food items purchased, the program will read the number of each item that was bought and display how many times that item was purchased for each item).
#
# "What did you do particularly well?"
#
# What I did particularly well on this program was the structure and organization of the overall program.  I developed my cpp code to handle UI display and user input to work in tandem with the the cpp starter code.  The Python code was reserved to specificallyt read and manipulate data from the input file based on user input.
#
# "Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?"
#
# I could have enhanced the overall formatting of my cpp code.  For instance, I could have used a switch-case statement to dictate actions following user input rather than an if-else statement, I could have used endl to add whitespace between menu prompts rather than "\n", etc.
#
# "Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?"
#
# The most challenging aspect of developing my code was utilizing the correct commands of the starter code to call to the code I developed in my Python code.  I initially received a runtime exception when calling out to the functions in my Python code which ended up being the result of calling the wrong command (i.e. using CallProcedure rather than callIntFunction).
#
# "What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?"
#
# Being able to incorporate multiple programming languages when developing a program is an immensly important skill to have.  Throughout this course, I've learned that each programming language has strengths and weaknesses, and some langauages are more adept to handling certain tasks and functions than others.  Utilizing multiple languages  allows a program to build on those strengths and produce higher-level functions.
#
# "How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?"
#
# I incorporated industry standards to ensure that the code I developed was readable and reusable, that my code was formatted well and incorporated in-line comments to explain what each section of the code is responsible for.
